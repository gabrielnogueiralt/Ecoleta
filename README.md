<a id="about"></a>

## :bookmark: About

The <strong>Ecoleta</strong> is a Web and Mobile application to help people find collection points for recycling.

This application was built on the trail <strong>Booster</strong> of <strong>Next Level Week</strong> distributed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). The idea of creating an application focused on the environment arose from the coincidence of the course date and the date of the <strong>environment week</strong>
